 # Congratulations!!
 
 Now you are a bass player...😎😎 even if just on this Playground😬😂
 But... let me tell you a story... this playground is how about I started to play bass.
 
 One day some friends of mine invited me to play a bass in their band practice, but at that time, I had never played bass in my life...😬
 But I went, even though I was clueless…
 
 They show me what notes I needed to play. After I memorized the notes, I memorized the sequence of notes of the music...
 That way, I learned three musics in one day...😂😂
 
 After that day, I decided to study bass for the rest of my life... and today, music is my passion.
 on that day, with my friends, I had a motivation: Try something I knew nothing about
 
 ...
 
 To make this playground, I had a motivation too, but now, the motivation is different.*/
let motivation = "WWDC19"
